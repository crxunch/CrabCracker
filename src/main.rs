/*
    basic functionality:
        1. the user supplies arguments about hashing algorithm, hashlist or hash, and wordlist
        2. read from wordlist
        3. hash contents of wordlist and compare hashes with contents of hashlist
        4. Store the cracked hashes in a file
    
    neccesary functions:
        1. Common hashing algorithms (MD5, SHAx)
        2. file operations

    future features:
        1. multiple hashes in one file
        2. multithreading
